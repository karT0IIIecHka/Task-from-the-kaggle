[Where are the seagulls?](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/where-are-the-seagulls)

Utašuda is home to a breeding seal rookery and one of the largest colonies of Pacific gulls in Kamchatka (4,000 pairs). Over the course of a single season, more than 1,800 photographs of varying quality can be collected. These photographs are used by inspectors to assess the welfare and abundance of the animals.

 Develop an algorithm that can be used to count and identify gulls using photographs.
